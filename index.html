    </summary>
    <p class="answer">
      An FAQ is a list of frequently asked questions (FAQs) and answers
      on a particular topic (also known as Questions and Answers [Q&A] or
      Frequently Answered Questions). The format is often used in articles,
      websites, email lists, and online forums where common questions tend to
      recur, for example through posts or queries by new users related to
      common knowledge gaps. The purpose of an FAQ is generally to provide
      information on frequent questions or concerns; however, the format is a
      useful means of organizing information, and text consisting of questions
      and their answers may thus be called an FAQ regardless of whether the
      questions are actually frequently asked[1].
